Disable PDF printing with PDFbox https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi
You need to include the pdfbox jar for this to work. (I used: pdfbox-app-1.8.7.jar)

Please not that you can easily use the PDFbox commandline arguments to achieve the same thing. There is excelent documentation on their website.

This of course doesn't affect PDF readers that don't adhere to DRM rights.

Another cool way to prevent people from copying certain things is: http://wildsparx.com/eurionize/
the main weakness of eurionize is however that it only works on works of color.
